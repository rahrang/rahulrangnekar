As I continue to utilize third-party components (this markdown parser is `markdown-to-jsx`), this project became my first attempt to create an open-source component for the React community.

I built this component -- a bar of social media icons -- for two main reasons:

1.  I discovered that for every website, I would use the exact same structure and code for external links to social media profiles.
2.  I wanted to learn to create tools helpful for others in the React community.

This project helped me accomplish both.

The `react-social-media-bar` uses Font Awesome brand icons to generate a bar of social media icons. Developers can specify the icons, colors, opacities, and styles for all icons as a whole or individually.

For an example of the component, check out the social media icons at the bottom of this page.
