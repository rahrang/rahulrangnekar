I joined this marketing and business fraternity in my sophomore year at Cal.

## Prospective Member Trainer

I will be training the Mu prospective member class in the Spring 2018 semester, teaching a group of students skills from marketing and interviewing to writing and technology. My chief goal is to impart on this group knowledge I wish I had earlier in my college career, and develop these members to lead PSE in future semesters.

## Vice President of Marketing

In December 2016, I was elected to serve as PSE Vice President of Marketing for one year.

As the only brother studying Computer Science in the fraternity (at the time), I took on the responsibility of managing the website. In the first month of my term, I designed and developed the fraternity website from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I closed our Squarespace account, saving us $113 annually, and hosted the new website via GitHub.

In my first iteration of the website, I created personal biography pages for each brother within the fraternity - a feature we previously lacked. This would allow potential prospective members to research our brothers before recruitment events at the beginning of the semester.

In my summer 2017 software development internship, I learned my way around the JavaScript library React as I built a web application for a client.

As I knew my term as VP of Marketing would end later in the year, with the next VP having to take on the website management, I decided to re-build the fraternity website with React for several reasons:

1.  It would be easier for myself and future contributors to develop.
2.  It would be easier to scale the website with React than with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separately.
3.  It would give myself and future contributors experience with React, a library maintained by Facebook and which is becoming increasingly popular in industry.
4.  It would open up a wonderful developer community and third-party components/modules to incorporate into the website.

From mid-July to mid-August, I would spend my days working on the web application at my internship. I would then go home and spend my nights developing this website. This became the second iteration of the website.

Improvements to the website continued throughout the Fall 2017 semester - I migrated from Google Forms to collect potential member applications toward Redux and `redux-form`. This included creating an `express` server using Node JS and connecting in a MongoDB database hosted via mLab. As the website transformed from static to dynamic, GitHub was no longer a viable host; I moved hosting and deployment duties to Heroku. This all improved the professional image of our website and fraternity.

Towards the end of my term, my focus turned to detailing my process in developing the website. This included writing several instructional files on everything from how to set up your machine to contribute to the website, to the project file structure, technologies used, **what** and **which** changes to make at what points in the semester, and **why** this project was important to the fraternity.

Even though I will no longer be the VP of Marketing in my last semester at Cal, I will be helping my successor and the Director of Technology to understand the codebase and improve the website.

Beyond the website, I had several additional responsibilities as VP of Marketing. Most of these involved developing the fraternity brand on social media and in-person. With aid from my Directors of Technology, we created hard-copy flyers for recruitment, Facebook cover photos, events, and content calendars for professional and philanthropic events throughout the year. We also took professional headshots for active brothers, and I recorded and edited a 40-minute farewell video for our senior brothers who graduated in Spring 2017. I was also in charge of ordering fraternity apparel, and attended weekly executive board and chapter meetings.

I also taught a Photoshop and Illustrator workshop for the Lambda class of prospective members.

## Director of Brotherhood

In Fall 2016, the semester after I became a PSE brother, I took on the role of Director of Brotherhood. I planned a day-long retreat to Santa Cruz for our 40 active members, as well as social events such as a pumpkin-carving contest, a rock-climbing night, and our end-of-semester banquet.
