My wife and I are chronic overpackers. We tend to pack more than we need, sometimes justifiably so[^1], but it often leads to stressful situations. During our most recent trip (April 2024), we spent almost an hour at the Stockholm airport rearranging our belongings in our luggage and carry-ons before checking it in. While I did find out later that the warning message I was getting when trying to self check-in our bags was that they needed "heavy" tags, not that they were too heavy to accept, the end result was the same: I was sweaty and frustrated. I started thinking about how I'd want us to pack differently the next time around.

[^1]: My wife is a marathoner and we both love to run when we visit new places, so we pack athletic clothes & running shoes. As vegetarians, we also pack protein bars & powder to ensure we can get enough protein, as some places we've been (looking at you, Lake Como & Positano) really just donâ€™t have sufficient vegetarian options.

This is a living list of my packing tips for future travels. I hope you find them useful.

## Before your trip

1. Underpack

   This is especially relevant if (1) you're visiting places that will have whatever you need, or (2) you're debating whether or not to take something you _might_ need but won't _definitely_ need.

   During our April 2024 trip, we visited London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Antwerp, flying between each city. Before our trip, the weather throughout all locations was relatively cool (~30Â°F / ~0Â°C) with chances of rain. While I was concerned about the weather, I ultimately decided not to pack my puffy coat and waterproof boots, with the justification that (1) they took up too much space and I didn't want to save space by wearing those while traveling between locations, and (2) I could just buy it if I absolutely needed it. All the cities we would visit definitely had malls.

   During the trip, even though it was cold and rained some days, I ended up not needing a warmer coat or rain boots.

2. Don't pack what you won't need (a.k.a. be reasonable)

   While I didn't pack the things I thought I could do without, I did pack one long-sleeve and several short-sleeve and athletic shirts. During the trip, I quickly learned that while I do run warm in general, I don't run warm enough to go on chilly morning runs in short-sleeve shirts. I ended up only wearing one of those shirts just once, while the others simply took up valuable space.

   The lesson here is to be reasonable and really think hard about how the clothes you pack will work in the expected weather. Just because you have certain clothes doesn't necessarily mean they're the _right_ clothes for the weather, no matter how badly you want them to be.

3. Pack for reuse reasonably

   I could've worn those otherwise unused athletic short-sleeve shirts, but there was a problem -- two of those shirts had V-necks and the other was a green tye-dye. While I'm comfortable wearing those while working out, I didn't like the idea of wearing those throughout the day when walking throughout the city or sitting in a restaurant or taking pictures I'd want to cherish forever. My wife is always so pretty, and I didn't want to stick out like a sore thumb next to her.

   When you pack clothes, make sure you can wear them for any occasion, not just the one they're meant for. If I'd have packed some of my more "normal" athletic clothes (a maroon shirt, for instance), I would've at least been able to consider whether or not I wanted to wear it out for the day.

4. If you have a 7+ day trip, pack less and do laundry

   Our three trips to Europe together have been at least two weeks each. In the first two trips, we were lucky enough [^2] to have access to a washer & dryer via public laundromat. In this most recent trip, however, that wasn't the case. We ended up doing our laundry in our hotel room -- washing it in the bathroom sink and hanging it to dry over the bathtub or with the provided hangers. It went better than I'd expected, and it was far more convenient than trying to find a laundromat or packing enough clothes to last us the entire trip without having to do laundry.

   If your trip will last longer than a week, I highly recommend just packing enough for a week or 10 days _at most_, and then just doing your laundry during your trip. A morning at a public laundromat (hopefully with coffee nearby) is a great way to relax in the middle of a trip. While washing your clothes in your hotel room will take maybe half an hour to an hour, waiting for those clothes to dry definitely takes longer -- I recommend only washing clothes that will have time to dry for a full day before you need them again (either to wear, or to pack away for your next location).

   [^2]: As in, I planned for it that way ðŸ˜…

5. Spare clothes in backpack

6. Ziplocs and bags are invaluable

## During your trip

1. Keep souveniers small

2. Heavier items go in smaller bags (for bags that will be checked-in)

3. Things you don't/won't need anymore should be packed away
