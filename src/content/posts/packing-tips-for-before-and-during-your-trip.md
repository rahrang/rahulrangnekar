My wife and I are chronic overpackers. We pack more than we need, sometimes justifiably so, but it often leads to stressful situations. Most recently (April 2024), we spent almost an hour at the Stockholm airport rearranging our belongings in our luggage and carry-ons before checking it in. I later found out that the warning message I was getting when trying to self check-in our bags was that they needed "heavy" tags, not that they were too heavy to accept. In any case, I was so sweaty and frustrated by the time we got to our gate, I started thinking about how I'd pack differently the next time around.

This is a living list of my tips on how I plan to pack for future travel, _and why_.

1. Underpack, don't overpack

   This is especially important if you're visiting places that will have whatever you need (think: cities will malls), or it's unlikely you'll need something.

2. Heavier items go in smaller bags (for bags that will be checked-in)

3. Pack less, and do laundry in the hotel sink

4. Keep souveniers small

5. Spare clothes in backpack

6. Things you don't/won't need anymore should be packed away

7. Pack athletic shirts you can wear daily, or vice versa

8. Ziplocs and bags are invaluable
