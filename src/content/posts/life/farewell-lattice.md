In September 2019, I joined [Lattice](https://www.lattice.com) as a Software Engineer. My last day with Lattice was last month, in January 2025. I’ve had the contents of this post in the back of my mind for almost two months now, and so it’s time to finally get it all out.

## Here’s some fun statistics during my time at Lattice

- I joined as the 20<sup>th</sup> engineer and 111<sup>th</sup> employee. At the time I left, the engineering org was around 150 employees, and the company around 600 employees.
- The company raised its Series C, D, E, and F, with the most recent round valuing the company [at $3 billion](https://lattice.com/blog/lattice-triples-valuation-to-3b-raises-175m-in-series-f-funding-round).
- I worked on seven different product lines (Feedback, One on Ones, Updates, Goals, Compensation Rewards, Compensation Cycles, and Core UI Platform) across five teams, with eight managers across ten changes, eight product managers, and nine designers. The longest period I had with a manager was exactly one year.
- At the time I left, I had been there longer than 95% of the company, including all of the C-suite executives and all but one of the senior leadership team. Only four other engineers had been there longer than me.

## So much life has happened.

In the almost five and half years I’d been at Lattice, I lived so much in my personal life. Any one of these could be its own post, but in quick roughly chronological summary:

1. The pandemic started around six months in, so I briefly experienced daily in-person work before going remote for the rest of my tenure. At times, work felt like a respite when it seemed like we couldn’t really do anything else.
2. Kimi and I, dating for a bit over two years at that point, moved in together.
3. We got a beautiful shiba inu puppy, Tofu.
4. We lost Tofu in a tragic and traumatic accident just five months later. It left a hole in my heart that’ll never completely heal, and continues to shape my world view to this day.
5. Kimi and I got engaged.
6. Both my remaining grandparents passed away.
7. Kimi and I got married, in a small ceremony with immediate family and an intimate reception with extended family & friends.
8. Kimi and I traveled quite a lot -- we’d been to New York several times, Portland quite a few times, and visited many countries new to us.

## It took privilege, luck, and risk aversion to have worked at a single employer for this entire time.

The tech (and world) economy has undergone significant changes in the past 5+ years. The pandemic hit, and so did layoffs from market uncertainty. Lattice let go of a small number (~5% = <15) of employees. Then the market exploded and virtually every tech company "hyperscaled". Lattice grew from around 175 employees to over 700. This was the first time I considered switching companies for a potentially more lucrative role, but I honestly loved the work I was doing and the people I was doing it with, so I didn’t really pursue new opportunities.

When the market inevitably course corrected, almost every company that hyperscaled conducted layoffs, and [so did Lattice](https://lattice.com/blog/ceo-jack-altmans-email-to-lattice-employees) -- around 15% of employees were laid off in January 2023.

I remember that day vividly. At the time, I was leading our Total Compensation project. In my mind, Carta was the closest competitor for the product. The day before Lattice’s layoffs, [Carta laid off 10% of its employees](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/carta-lays-off-10-as-cto-lawsuit-looms/). When I read about it, I reflected on how good the Lattice was doing and how much trust I had in its leadership. Unfortunately, that trust was misplaced and also never truly recovered, but through the survivor’s guilt, _I learned a lot from that experience_.

Over the remainder of the 2023, I had my frustrations with Lattice, but my perception of the market dissuaded me from considering "greener" pastures. Throughout 2024 (and continuing into 2025), several markets, companies, (and even our federal government 🙄), laid off employees under the guise of replacing them with Artificial Intelligence "resources".

So, I consider myself:

- privileged, to be in a relatively "safe" industry working at a company that allowed me to work fully remote
- lucky, in the sense that _I_ wasn’t laid off
- risk-averse, in that I _probably_ could’ve changed jobs (especially when the market was booming), but I chose not to for several reasons.

I don’t regret my decision to remain at Lattice for as long as I did. In fact...

## I have tons of gratitude for having a stable income and work-life flexibility to do all I’ve done.

Through the good and bad, Lattice and its people were kind towards me, and I consider myself lucky for that, because not everyone had that same experience. Working at Lattice supported my lifestyle -- Kimi and I were able to get engaged and married, travel domestically frequently and internationally at least once a year. We were able to live comfortably, grow our incomes and savings, and only feel as much financial stress as we put on ourselves. While other parts of life were stressful, Lattice and work remained relatively not.

## I learned so much professionally

- How to work with more than three other coworkers
- How to work with a team -- other engineers, designers, product managers, and be a report that managers liked to work with
- How to work (hopefully, pleasantly) in another team’s codebase
- How to work cross-functionally with Marketing & Sales teams
- How to lead a team / project, be a tech lead
- How to prioritize work and learn when to say no
- How to bite off around exactly or less than what I can actually chew
- How to gauge what makes (in my opinion) a good manager, leader, and company
- so much more I can't possibly enumerate it...
- When to say goodbye ❤️👋🏽
